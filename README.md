# Eternal-Winter
A mod for minecraft that enables snow in every biome
This projects is split up in two parts: A normal mod for client and server and a coremod if this mod should be used server only.

It's best to avoid the coremod if possible by just installing the mod on server <b>and</b> client. You should only use the coremod
if you want vanilla clients to connect to the server
